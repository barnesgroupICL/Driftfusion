%% A script to reproduce the results from Calado et al. 2016
% The results obtained here will be approximately the same as those
% presented in Calado 2016. Note that there may be some differences in the
% exact solutions owing to the difference in the methods used. Previously
% the Current-Voltage scan was reproduced using a discretised step-wise
% method (one solution per point) whereas here a single solution is used.
% Similarly the open circuit voltage transients were obtained using a
% symmetric model method previously while here a series resistance is
% applied to the boundary conditions.
% Note also that the ions have been accelerated by two orders of magnitude
% as compared to the original publication mu_ion = 10^-10 cm2V-1s-1 to aid
% convergence of the solutions
