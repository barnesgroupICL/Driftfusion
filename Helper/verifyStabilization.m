function all_stable = verifyStabilization(sol_matrix, t_array, time_fraction)
%VERIFYSTABILIZATION - Checks if the solution reached a stabilized status comparing the final time point with a manually specified time point
% Beware that this can have false positives when the analyzed solution had
% a tmax so small that the ionic movement did not even start.
% A false negative can be obtained when the relative tolerance of the pdepe
% solver is larger than the default 1e-3.
%
% Syntax:  all_stable = verifyStabilization(sol_matrix, t_array, time_fraction)
%
% Inputs:
%   SOL_MATRIX - a solution matrix, not the full struct, as contained in
%     structs created by DF
%   T_ARRAY - the time mesh array, as generated by meshgen_t and included
%     in structs created by DF
%   TIME_FRACTION - numeric between 0 and 1. The smaller the stricter the
%     check. When 1: disable the stability check and simply return true.
%     When zero or strictly included between 0 and 1: check if the
%     solution reached a stabilization. Suggested values: 1e-3 for
%     normal cases, 0 for cases in which the stabilization is very
%     important, 1 for cases in which the first solution is needed.
%
% Outputs:
%   ALL_STABLE - a logic asserting if the solution in input reached its
%     stability
%
% Example:
%   verifyStabilization(soleq.ion.u, soleq.ion.t, 1e-3)
%     check if the solution did not change much from a time which is one
%     thousandth of the final time point and the final time point
%
% Other m-files required: none
% Subfunctions: none
% MAT-files required: none
